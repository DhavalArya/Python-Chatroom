# Python-Chatroom
Demonstration of Asynchronous Non-Blocking threads and callbacks through the simulation of a Reactor EventLoop without using asyncio. This is demonstrated through the working of a chatroom that is monitored by a server and accessed by clients. We can replace reactor eventloop by Proactor eventloop.
